# 3d-drain-cork

**Replacement part for a water stopper / drain plug for a 35 mm drain outlet size.**

## Description

This item is a 35mm drain cover, designed for use in kitchen sinks or washing tank. Additionally, it features a hook for easy hanging. I personally used a little stainless steel chain, but it can also be secured using a zip tie or a cord.

I printed it in PLA, achieving excellent results. I had to include a raft to print the hook because, being a small piece, it detached easily from the print bed.
